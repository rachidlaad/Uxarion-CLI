Next steps: Execute the queued scans safely, then conduct targeted OWASP Top 10-focused tests (auth/authz, input validation, session management, file handling, deserialization), review server/config headers and access controls, capture request/response evidence, and deliver remediation guidance per each confirmed issue.",
